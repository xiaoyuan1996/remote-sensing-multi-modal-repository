# Multi-modal Repository under Remote Sensing 

### We are going to use the existing resources to make a set of remote sensing multimodal library, which is expected to include RS caption, retrieval, text-to-image, semantic localization, etc.

### If there is a need, please give a :+1:_<big>`star `:+1:_<big>, and you can also put forward the required functions in the issue.

### We will start this work in the next few days if there are more people to give us the stars.
